      <p>Since the dawn of time pizza and fitness have been at odds. Pizza with its heavy amounts of grease, bread, cheese, and fat. While fitness on the other hand...well honestly if we have to explain it’s benefits then it may be time to go back to grade school gym class. No matter your education level Fitness Pizza aims to join these now former adversaries together to help you slide your way into better health. It’s simple, really! Tell Fitness pizza how hard, or soft, you trained that day. It then bakes all that data into a tangible, understandable, result:</p> 
      
      <p><b>Slices of delicious pizza</b>.</p> 

      <p>Ok, not actually real pizza, but it will tell you, based off your calories burned, how many slices you burned off that body of yours. Giving you the power to know, for sure, if you really did earn that coveted cheat meal.</p>
      
      <p>Because, c’mon, isn’t that really all you want to know from a fitness tracker?</p>
